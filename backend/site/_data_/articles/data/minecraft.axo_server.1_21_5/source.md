**After a week of work and a happy easter the server is finally updated! üê£**
<br><br>

## ServerSide
**Version Change**
Updated the server to the Spring to Life drop *(1.21.5)*, adding cold and warm variants to animals and new decorative bushes.<br>
And not to forget the cactus flower!ü™∑
<br><br>

**Mod Changes**
- Replaced `AntiEntityGrief` with `MobExplosionGamerule` since the former has not updated.<br>
- Testing an unfinished version of `BluemapMarkerManager` since it has not updated.<br>
- Skipped the `HorseBuff` mod since I need time to test if crashes has been fixed.<br>
- Skipped `Noisium` since it is not updated.<br>
<br>

**Datapack Changes**
- Updated all vanilla-tweaks datapacks to 1.21.5.
- `MoreArmorTrims` has been removed for now, I might make another custom fork if I have time but we will see. For now if you have issues with previously trimmed armor not rendering contact me.
- Made a custom fork of `Pengu's Head Equip` so the curse-of-binding check should now work again. *(If not please contact me)*
- Added `painting-picker` from vanilla-tweaks allowing you to get items for specific paintings using a stonecutter. Recommended to be used with their `Unique Painting Items` resourcepack.
<br><br>

**Resourcepack Changes**<br>
Completely remade the server resourcepack, phew!<br>
Since Mojang added the ability of CIT in vanilla the server's custom items no longer require Optifine or CIT-Resewn!<br>
This does mean the way custom items are made has also changed, and what items can be made by players.<br>
<li><p>Flower crowns can now be crafted by placing three of the flower items next to each other in the crafting grid.<p>
  <ul style="line-height:5px;">
    <li><p>For `pink_daisy` use `pink petals`.</p>
    <li><p>For `buttercup` use `raw gold`</p>
  </ul>
</li>
- Flower crowned armor helmets are now craftable by combining your helmet and the flower-item in the grafting grid. **(Please note this can't be undone)**
- Steampunk goggles are now craftable using this recipe:<br>
  <img src="article_asset:/mc/axo/server/1.21.5/demo_crafting_steampunk_goggles.png"/><br>
- Miners helmets are now craftable by combining a `leather helmet` with a `glowstone dust`.
- Multiple decorated eggs are now avaliable by renaming an `egg`. Ex: `Blue Egg` or `Blue Ornate Egg`. *(This is different from the easter-hunt exclusives)*
- Playerdolls are for now no longer obtainable by renaming armor stands. *(This might return later)*
- Cosmetic hats are no longer obtainable by renaming carved pumpkins. Rather the idea is to give these out, or make them rewards. *(Feedback is appreciated)*
<br>
I have manually migrated the items I found on the server, if you have un-migrated legacy custom items please contact me.<br> **BUT DO NOT MOVE THEM!** I will need the coordinates of where they where placed `2025-04-21` to verify them.<br> *(If you do not know the cordinates or have questions just contact me anyways)*<br>
**The migration does of course include items that are no longer obtainable but existed before, ex. cosmetic hats.**<br>
<br>

## Whats next?
- Stability testing!
- Checking for anything broken by the update.
- Finalizing and testing the newly pre-released `1.21.5` clients.
- Evaluating the [Vivecraft](https://modrinth.com/mod/vivecraft) mod.


## And of course:
A bit late, but Happy Easter! üê£
